# Since this is probably your first experience with TDD, let's extend the
# workflow to include a few more steps:
# 1. Read & understand the requirement for one method only.
# 2. Write one test for that method; run the tests to see it fail.
# 3. Write the method to fulfill the requirement.
# 4. Run the tests again. If they don't all pass, redo steps 1-3.
# 5. When your first test is passing, write the additional tests.
# 6. Run all of the tests. If any do not pass, redo steps 3-5.
# 7. Optional: Refactor your code and/or tests, keeping all tests passing.
