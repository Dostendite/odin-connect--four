# Ruby Connect Four for TOP

ðŸ”° [**Live Preview**](https://replit.com/@skimgus12/odin-connect-four)
This was my first TDD project!

## Possible improvements:

* Maybe divide up the ConnectFour class into others?
* Refactor the `print_board`, `check_four` methods and others
* Add a rainbow animation to the connected four when a player win
* Add replayability
* Improve the aesthetics
